// Given any positive integer N, you are supposed to find all of its prime factors, and write them in the format N = p1(k1)×p2(k2)×⋯×pm(km).
//
// Input Specification:
// Each input file contains one test case which gives a positive integer N in the range of long int.
//
// Output Specification:
// Factor N in the format N = p1^k1*p2^k2*…*pm^km, where p(i)'s are prime factors of N in increasing order, and the exponent k(i) is the number of p(i) -- hence when there is only one p(i), k(i) is 1 and must NOT be printed out.

// Sample Input:
// 97532468

// Sample Output:
// 97532468=2^2*11*17*101*1291
